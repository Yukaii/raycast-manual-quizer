> ⚠️Our native Reminders extension is now deprecated. We recommend downloading the new and improved extension from the Raycast Store:

##### Raycast - Apple Reminders

Manage Apple Reminders.

www.raycast.com

Here's what's new in the store extension:

-   📋 View and manage your reminders from the menu bar
-   ➕ Quickly get reminders out of your head using plain language
-   🗂️ Group, sort, and order your reminders according to your preferences
-   ✅ Display completed reminders from within a list
-   Other improvements such as editing a reminder, creating a reminder from an empty list, and more!

Raycast connects to Apple's Reminders and lets you jot down to-dos to not forget about them. You can also complete your reminders straight from Raycast.
