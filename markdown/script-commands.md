Script Commands lets you tailor Raycast to your needs and speed up every-day tasks. The simple scripts allow you to trigger your custom workflows from Raycast.

Some examples:

-   Control your Mac, e.g. toggle hidden files
-   Trigger dev workflows, e.g. create an internal release
-   Integrate your home automation, e.g. turn off your lights in the office
