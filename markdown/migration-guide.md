Got a new Mac? Follow this guide to migrate your Raycast setup and stay produtive the minute you open your new device.

## Steps to Follow

1.  Install all your applications first. This guarantees that aliases and hotkeys work right away without further setup.
2.  Open Raycast and skip the the onboarding.
3.  When you open the Raycast app and go to Raycast Settings (`⌘` `,`), then Account tab, make sure that you are logged in.
4.  If you have a pro account, you can enable Cloud Sync on your new Mac. Make sure that Cloud Sync was previously enabled on your old Mac. Otherwise you can loose some data.
5.  Run the `Export Settings & Data` command on your old Mac.
6.  Airdrop the exported file to your new Mac and double click to import your previous configuration.

Depending on the amount of installed extensions and customizations, the import might take a few minutes.

## Things that aren’t migrated

The export command doesn’t migrate the following:

1.  Screenshots. To migrate those, simply copy them over to your new machine. If you want to keep them always synchronized, you can set up a folder in your iCloud Drive or Dropbox.
2.  Clipboard History
3.  Emoji Picker custom keywords
