To make it even easier to use your favorite Commands, you can set up a Command Alias or Hotkey.

To set them up, go to _Raycast Settings → Extensions._ You can then find the desired Command and add an Alias or a Hotkey.

## Differences between Aliases and Hotkeys

Depending on your use case, you may want to choose whether to set up an Alias, a Hotkey, or both. Here’s an overview.

### Aliases

If you define an alias for your Command, you can type the alias, followed by your search query. Aliases are useful for commands that require arguments, such as a search query.

For example, if you often search for files, you need to use the _File Search_ Command, press ⏎ and finally type in your search query. To speed this up let’s assign `f` as an Alias to the _File Search_ Command. You can now type `f` followed by a space and your search query.

### Hotkeys

Hotkeys are global and always available at your fingertips. It’s the fastest way to run a Command.

For example, if you often use the _Center_ Command from Window Management, you need to open Raycast, search for _Center_ and press ⏎. To speed this up, let’s give it the following Hotkey `⌃` `⌥` `⌘` `C`. You can now press `⌃` `⌥` `⌘` `C` from anywhere on your computer to trigger the _Center_ Command_._

Hotkeys are useful whether they are a “No View” Command such as _Center_ or a “View” Command such as _File Search_.
