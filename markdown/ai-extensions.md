Raycast AI Extensions let you interact and instruct using natural language. Describe what you want to do, add the relevant AI Extensions to your message or chat, and let AI do the hard work

## 🚀 Getting started

You can use one or multiple AI Extensions in a message, and then describe your intent. They are supported across Raycast AI. Here’s how to use them:

1.  Root Search: type `@` and find all AI Extensions. They start with “Ask…”
2.  Quick AI, AI Commands, AI Chat message: type `@` to find AI Extensions in a menu. You use them as an `@mention` inline. You need the `Ray-1` model. New chats automatically switch to use this model when the message contains an AI Extension.
3.  AI Chat Presets / Settings. You can add AI Extensions to the list. You cannot @mention an AI Extension in the System instructions.

AI Chat Preset with AI Extensions

## 🗒️ Custom instructions

Custom Instructions let you tell Raycast AI how you want it to use an extension. Some examples:

-   **Calendar:** Explain when to add a meeting link for Zoom or to Google Meet or describe how much free time to keep between meetings.
-   **Finder:** Describe your formatting of files and folders.
-   **Linear:** Let it know your preferred team, or the structure of filing bugs.
-   **Weather:** Specify which conditions you care to see - like temperature and precipitation - and display it in nicely in a table or use the additional @chart tool

You can add Custom Instructions in Raycast Settings → Extensions.

## 📣 AI Reliability

As with all things AI, reliability is a tricky thing to get right. In order to improve and continually make Raycast AI more reliably and useful, we need to understand what works and what doesn’t.

Providing feedback— the good and the bad - helps us to do this.

If you come across examples that do what you intended particularly well, or that missed the mark, you can report them to us by hitting the 👍 or 👎 button on the message.

![A feedback prompt will show after each message with an AI Extension](https://images.spr.so/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/j42No7y-dcokJuNgXeA0ig/27c3a53d-21b0-451f-a824-d27bea8b862b/Raycast_2025-02-24_at_14.10.24/w=3840,quality=90,fit=scale-down)

A feedback prompt will show after each message with an AI Extension

When you report feedback, the full chat thread — including all AI Extension tool calls and results — will be sent to us. We handle this data with the same privacy and security as outlined in our ToS and Privacy Policy. However, please be mindful of any sensitive data the thread might contain.
