You can share Quicklinks with members of your organization. It's an easy way to access information and is ideal for links to your company's roadmap, dashboards, or other resources.

> 💡You must enable organizations in Raycast and have created your first organization before you can create a shared Quicklink.

## Create Shared Quicklink

-   Search for the _**Create Quicklink**_ command in Raycast.
-   In the form select your Organization.
-   Then enter a name and URL for the Quicklink
-   Finally use `⌘ Enter` to create and publish the Quicklink.

Your Quicklink will now be available in Raycast for all of your organization’s members. Shared Quicklinks display the organisation’s icon on the right-hand side of the item:

Shared Quicklinks are synced automatically between all organization members. Any changes to a shared Quicklink made by one member will be propagated to all other members.

## Managing Shared Quicklinks

To manage shared Quicklinks use the **_Manage Quicklinks_** command. By default you will see a list of your personal Quicklinks - these are stored locally in Raycast and not synced. To view your organization’s shared quicklinks choose your organization from the filter menu at the top-right of the window.

You can perform various actions on the selected Quicklink using the action panel (`⌘ K`), including _Edit_, _Duplicate_, _Move_ (to another organization) or _Delete_. You’ll be prompted to confirm before a destructive action such as move or delete. You can also create a new Quicklink using the _Create Quicklink_ action.

## Preferences

You can also view and manage your shared Quicklinks in Raycast’s Preferences. Select the _Extensions_ item and then the _Quicklinks_ filter.

Your organisation’s Quicklinks will appear in a separate group. You can perform actions on the selected Quicklink via the right-click context menu. Select the organization’s group to create a new Quicklink from scratch or from Raycast’s built-in library of pre-defined Quicklinks.
