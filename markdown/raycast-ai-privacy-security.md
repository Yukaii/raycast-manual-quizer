At Raycast, we prioritize your privacy and security in all our AI features. With this document, we aim to provide clarity and transparency about how AI works in Raycast and our commitment to privacy and security.

-   Terms of Service
-   Privacy Policy

## Key Principles

You should know when and how AI is used and activated in Raycast. You should always be in control of your interaction with AI and have the ability to opt-out at any time. We will be transparent and open about how your data and AI inputs/outputs are used. We believe consent is crucial and aim to provide the best, most transparent AI user experience.

## **How Raycast AI Works**

Raycast AI only runs when you explicitly trigger it; meaning, you ask AI a question, run an AI command, or otherwise interact with AI directly. The only time AI may activate without explicitly being called is with Emoji Search - which is opt-in and requires your consent. Raycast AI does not run in the background or monitor your activity. Your data is not used to train AI models. If you choose to send feedback, your data may be used to improve our AI system; this is strictly opt-in and you will be prompted to consent before data is sent.

## About Raycast AI

### **Data Collection & Usage**

-   Your AI interactions are not recorded
-   We do not collect or store sensitive information

-   We do not log or retain any user prompts. We do store some basic metadata, such as the number of completion tokens, for operational purposes only.
-   Cloud Sync: when enabled, the client sends content such as Snippets, AI Chats, etc. to our backend. We store this information encrypted in our databases. A full overview what is synced can be found in our manual.
-   AI attachments: Image attachments are securely uploaded to our servers for AI processing, enabling you to access them later. If you delete a message or chat that includes attachments, those attachments will be deleted from the server.
-   AI Feedback: If you choose to report feedback, the full chat thread — including AI Extension tool calls and results — will be sent to us. This is **entirely opt-in** and you must give explicit consent before any data is sent. **Please be mindful of any sensitive data the thread might contain.** We may use this information to improve the reliability of our AI System.

### **AI Processing & Partners**

-   Our AI features are powered by leading providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, and more
-   All AI processing occurs through secure server infrastructure to ensure the safety of our API keys
-   BYOK (Bring Your Own Key):

-   Anthropic, Google, OpenAI: Requests are processed through our servers in order to unify the model APIs, integrate fallback behaviors, and do some final prompt management. This helps to maintain the quality and consistency of output when using your own API key vs. ours.
-   OpenRouter: Requests are routed directly from your device to OpenRouter's servers.
-   Custom API keys are stored locally on the user’s computer, not in our backend
-   When using BYOK, you maintain the contractual relationship with the AI provider. Please consult their privacy policies and terms for more details.

-   When using Raycast AI (not BYOK), our agreements with the providers prohibit them from using any AI interactions to train their models (learn more here). When you use our AI features, we:

-   Forward your input to the AI provider's API
-   Exclude any personal information when doing so
-   Only share the minimum necessary data

-   AI input and output is encrypted during transmission

### **User Control & Transparency**

-   AI features are optional and user-controlled. Users can completely disable AI.

-   Before using Raycast AI, you will be prompted to read and accept our Terms of Service if you haven’t accepted them in the past. AI does not run in the background and you must actively consent before AI can be activated.

## Open Source Extensions

As a company that believes in the value and importance of open source software, Raycast has a rich and expansive extension ecosystem. Note that third-party extensions may use their own logic for AI. As all extensions are **open source**, you can refer to an extensions’ README or source code for further information.

We continuously review and update our privacy practices to maintain the highest standards of data protection while delivering powerful AI capabilities. If you have questions or suggestions, you can contact us via **privacy@raycast.com**.
