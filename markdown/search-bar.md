Use the Search Bar at the top of the window to quickly find content on the current screen.

-   The Search Bar is focused by default to make it quick to start typing your query.
-   We support fuzzy search. Typing _jci_ will find the Jira Create Issue command and _vs code_ will find the Visual Studio Code application.
-   Check the Search Bar placeholder in commands to see what you can search for.

## Root Search

Fuzzy Search is used in Root Search to provide a flexible _search experience_. You can match applications, extensions, or scripts by writing any of their letters independently of their position in the result’s title, subtitle, keywords, or alias. For example: `ftime` for “Facetime”, `msg` for “Messages”, or `utub vid` for the “Search Youtube Videos” command.

Fuzzy Search can be tweaked to ask the algorithm to return more or less results. This preferences are exposed in Raycast Settings > Advanced > Root Search Sensitivity.

A “High” sensitivity setting will make the algorithm stricter and therefore force the user to be more precise. A “Low” setting will return any element matching the letters written in the Search Bar.
