You can open Raycast with a global hotkey. It overlays your current application to keep you focused.

-   The default hotkey to open Raycast is `⌥` `Space`.
-   We recommend to replace Apple's Spotlight (or any other application launcher). This way you only need to remember one hotkey.

# Disable hotkey for Spotlight

If `⌘` `Space` doesn't work, that hotkey is assigned to another feature on your Mac. Most likely, it's configured to show Spotlight search. Go to **S**_**ystem Settings**_ **>** _**Keyboard**_ **>** _**Keyboard Shortcuts**_ **>** _**Spotlight**_

# Disable hotkey for language switching

If you use or have previously used multiple languages on your Mac, you will most likely have a conflicting setup. Go to _**System Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Input Sources**_ and disable or change the shortcut.

## Ensure "Ask Siri" is not using the same shortcut

By default **Siri** might be configured to use "hold `⌘` `Space`" or "hold `⌥` `Space`" shortcuts. When using same shortcut for Raycast, you might notice slight delay when toggling the main window. We recommend changing **Siri** shortcut to something else or just disabling it if you're not using this feature. Go to _**System Settings > Apple Intelligence & Siri**_ to configure it.
