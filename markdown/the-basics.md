Raycast stays out of your way but is always ready when you need it. This page gives you a brief overview of the basic concepts of Raycast.

Here are the basics to move quickly from your intent to an action:

-   Press the global Hotkey to open Raycast from anywhere (default: `⌥` `Space`).
-   On the root, search for apps and commands and open them with `↵`.
-   Use the suggestions, to open frequently and recently used ones even quicker.
-   Extensions are an essential part of Raycast. There are some built-in extensions, such as File Search and Window Management. You can also visit the Store, where you can find extensions created by us and our developer community.

> 💡**Pro Tip:** You can use Raycast as your default launcher and replace Spotlight. This way you keep your muscle memory for your global hotkey.

# First Steps
