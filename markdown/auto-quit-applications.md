## **How to Use**

### **Enable Auto Quit**

Find the application in Raycast’ root search. Then press `⌘` `K` to open the Action Panel and select the Enable Auto Quit action. If the app is running, a small orange dot under the app icon in Raycast’s root search, signals that Auto Quit is enabled for the app. The app will now automatically close after 3 minutes of inactivity.

You can change the interval after the app will be terminated via the application’s settings in Raycast.

### **Disable Auto Quit**

Avoid enabling Auto Quit for applications essential to your workflow or that need to run continuously in the background.
