The Raycast Core extension is a set of commands provided out of the box to give you an instant productivity boost.

# Clipboard History

Ever had the situation that you wanted to paste text that you copied earlier again? Raycast has a built-in Clipboard History for that. The command keeps track of copied text and makes it simple to paste it again.

-   Start typing to filter the items on the left. Press `↵` to copy the text and paste it where-ever you want.
-   On the right is a detail view with the full content and some additional metadata of the copied content.
-   Your copied text stays on your Mac, is fully encrypted and can only be read by you. The history can be kept until 3 months and respects your password manager.
-   You can pin your frequently used entries to the top with `⌘` `⇧` `P`. They won't get removed.

> 🗣

Clipboard history has a 32,768 character limit due to performance constraints. This limit cannot be modified.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

-   `↵` to copy selected entry to your clipboard

-   `⌘` `⇧` `P` to pin entry
