You must have seen these in Raycast, when you search term doesn't have any matching result, you see a list of pre-defined commands like File Search, Google Search.

You can customize them by searching for **Manage Fallback Commands** or clicking the settings icon in the section header when you have no matching results. You will see a list of enabled and available fallback commands.

The available section now contains all your Quicklinks and Script Commands with single argument. You can just hit enter on any of that to enable.

You can also change the order of the enabled commands using the action panel or keyboard shortcuts. The shortcuts should be familiar to you from the Favourites section in root search.
